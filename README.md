## [January 13th] Start of Notes!
on January 13th  I had my first meet with Erik Ostlund! We talked about what I wanted out of this mentorship, and a brief overview of types of developers. 

> - Frontend: Area where the user interacts, includes user interface
> - Backend: More data oriented, needing the data for the user to actually be able to interact
> - Fullstack: A developer that can perform both frontend and backend development

## **[Github](https://github.com/)**
Next we went over github, a place to control versions, and establish a main branch of a project. Next I went and made a github account. Erik showed me his profile and his projects on github to show how exactly it works. He also showed me S.goulas' project in which she writes a *[development dairy](https://github.com/sgoulas/pdpProject/tree/main/docs/DevelopmentDiary)* to record her progress and document what she learns. Erik stresses  the importance of documentation, so  you can document what youve done in a project for future reference.


## **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)**
Erik showed me how to install Visual Studio, and make a folder and make a file (this file). Our next objective was to get this file up on github, for this I had to install *[gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)*.

## **[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)**
After installing gitbash we decided to hold off on uploading it to github, and instead focusing on learning how to use markdown to a development dairy for my mentorship. To help get my self familiar with markdown, he showed my the markdown cheat sheet, to learn how to format with the language.

## [January 14th] Learning Git
The very first project update! That was today's goal, before getting into the main plate I would need some of the code for git. For this I was given a [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4), as well as a [cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet). A list of the commands we will be using. 
>- Init: Marks it as a git project
>- Clone: Replicates a project
>- Add: Stages changes for the commit actions
>- Commit: Commit your work to a save point
>- Status: Checks which files are staged or unstaged
>- Push: Push your changes into a main branch
>- Pull: Pull changes from main branch into your project to keep your version in synch

## **[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)**
One more way of using git is with a GUI (guided user interface). Unlike using a terminal which comes with any computer, it allows for easier commands with the press of a button, it also displays more information at a time making it easier to visualize your actions.

## **Making a Repository**
Before I can update any changes I must make a project on Github, which the first part is as easy as naming a project and setting up some basic settings, but next comes the code.
>- cd (desired destination)
>- dir
>- git init
>- git remote add origin (github repository)
>- git remote -v
>- git statis
>- git add README.md
>- git commit -m "initial commit"
>- git status
>- git push -u origin main

## **Updating a Repository**
Now that a repository has  been made, I need to update any  changed I make to the file. This is a much more simple process but is still enacted by the following lines of code.
>- cd (desired destination)
>- dir
>- git status
>- git add README.md
>- git status
>- git commit -m (message)
>- git status
>- git push -u origin main
