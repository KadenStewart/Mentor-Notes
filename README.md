## [January 13th] Start of Notes!
on January 13th  I had my first meet with Erik Ostlund! We talked about what I wanted out of this mentorship, and a brief overview of types of developers. 

> - Frontend: Area where the user interacts, includes user interface
> - Backend: More data oriented, needing the data for the user to actually be able to interact
> - Fullstack: A developer that can perform both frontend and backend development

## **[Github](https://github.com/)**
Next we went over github, a place to control versions, and establish a main branch of a project. Next I went and made a github account. Erik showed me his profile and his projects on github to show how exactly it works. He also showed me S.goulas' project in which she writes a *[development dairy](https://github.com/sgoulas/pdpProject/tree/main/docs/DevelopmentDiary)* to record her progress and document what she learns. Erik stresses  the importance of documentation, so  you can document what youve done in a project for future reference.


## **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)**
Erik showed me how to install Visual Studio, and make a folder and make a file (this file). Our next objective was to get this file up on github, for this I had to install *[gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)*.

## **[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)**
After installing gitbash we decided to hold off on uploading it to github, and instead focusing on learning how to use markdown to a development dairy for my mentorship. To help get my self familiar with markdown, he showed my the markdown cheat sheet, to learn how to format with the language.
